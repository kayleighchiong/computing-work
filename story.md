_**Hansel and Gretel**_


Witches come in all shapes and sizes. Some spend their entire lives in isolation. Some ride broomsticks and terrorise villagers while some perform magic tricks at birthday parties. Some look like the stereotypical old hag, with pointy noses and warts and skin as green as mint leaves, whereas some look like normal earthly beings. Some are nice while others are wicked.

I am the Candy Witch, and I am supposedly of the latter variety. You might have heard of the famous fairytale _Hansel and Gretel_. Yes, I am the very woman who is rumoured to have lured the "innocent" children into my gingerbread house, locked Hansel in a cage, then tried to fatten him up so I could roast him for dinner.

However, that is all one big lie. (_Pfft, I would never be caught dead eating a human. They smell **and** taste disgusting._)

The truth is that Hansel and Gretel are nasty little children who do not have an ounce of manners between them. They had been out in the dark forest one day, stomping on tiny insects and green ferns, ignoring "NO TRESPASSING" signs, when they saw a beautiful residence. The colourful house was covered in various types of candy, such as candy canes, caramel chocolate wafers and fruity gumdrops --- **my** house.

So, without asking for permission or waiting to be invited, they started to devour my house. Then, wanting more candy, the greedy children climbed through a window and started eating the interior. When I caught them in the act, I was very --- no, terribly --- upset. Anger stirred deep within me, yet I kept my cool. Calmly, I asked, "Dearies, whatever are you doing, eating my house? How would you like it if I ate yours?"

"Our house is made of bricks," Hansel chuckled, with a drawer handle of pepppermint candy canes sticking out of his mouth.

"And mortar," Gretel added between bites of a rope curtain made of black licorice, smirking. Her brother sniggered.

I frowned at their jeering remarks, my blood starting to boil. Yet, I continued to keep my frustration. in check. "That is not the point, dearies. The point is that my house belongs to **me**. It is very rude to eat something that belongs to someone else!" I chided.

"We don't care," Hansel and Gretel said in unison, their hands on their hips. The duo continued to stuff their faces with delicious sweet treats without a pinch of guilt. Then, Hansel proceeded to take a huge bite out of the chocolate tiara my mother had left behind for me before she passed. **That was the last straw.** _These two insolent fools!_ My anger spilt out of me like an overflowing pot of stew. In a fit of rage, I grabbed Hansel by his chestnut hair and threw him into a cage.

"Now, Gretel, dearie," I spoke in a sickeningly sweet voice. "You will clean up this mess before I let both of you go," I warned, in the hopes that Hansel and Gretel would learn not to be so rude in the future. With tears running down her cheeks faster than my heartbeat, Gretel sobbed as she swept the remains of my chest of drawers out of the front door.

Over the next few hours, Gretel cleaned the house until it was spick and span. When I was finally satisfied, I let Hansel out of the cage. "Good. Now, leave and make sure I never see you two again." I snapped before chasing them both out of my front door.

I thought that that would be the end of the matter, but little did I know how wrong I was. The moment I laid my eyes on the village newspaper the next morning, I spit out my morning hot chocolate. Fists clenching the newspaper, anger curled hot and unstoppable in my gut, like a burning inferno that wanted to burn me inside and out.  As it turns out, unruly Hansel and Gretel had returned home and told their horrid parents that **I** had forced them to eat candy and had thrown them in my stew pot to be cooked. "The little brats!" I cursed under my breath. 

The dreadful parents, of course, believed their awful children and told everyone they knew. Since no one ever believes a witch, Hansel and Gretel's version of the story was published in bestselling fairytale books. Thus, my reputation as a child-eating monster stuck to me like gooey caramel.

However, now that you have heard my side of the story, do you still think I am an evil witch? Or do you still believe that nasty lie Hansel and Gretel had spread?
